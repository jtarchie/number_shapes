# Explaination

Find the number of shapes in a grid system.

Using TDD, I approached the problem in several small steps. Sometimes
thinking about a problem requires breaking down into manageable parts. I
now have test coverage on my implementation, which was useful to know if
I had an regressions on the different approaches that I took.

# Usage

If Ruby is installed on your system.

```sh
bundle install
rspec spec/
```
